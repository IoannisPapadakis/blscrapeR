## Mapping County Data

County data mapped on a national scale can sometimes be difficult to see. The `get_bls_county()` and `bls_map_county()` functions both have arguments that will accommodate data and maps for specific states or groups of states.

The example below shows the most recent unemployment rates for Florida.

```{r eval=FALSE}
library(blscrapeR)
# Map the unemployment rate for the Southeastern United States.
df <- get_bls_county(stateName = "Florida")

bls_map_county(map_data=df, fill_rate = "unemployed_rate", 
               stateName = "Florida")
```

Also, the states can be called together to form larger districts. Below is an example of the most recent unemployment rates for the southeastern states of Florida, Georgia and Alabama.

```{r eval=FALSE}
# Map the unemployment rate for the Southeastern United States.
df <- get_bls_county(stateName = c("Florida", "Georgia", "Alabama"))

bls_map_county(map_data=df, fill_rate = "unemployed_rate", 
stateName = c("Florida", "Georgia", "Alabama"))
```

## More Advanced Mapping

What's R mapping without some interactivity? Below weâ€™re using two additional packages, `leaflet`, which is popular for creating interactive maps and `tigris`, which allows us to download the exact shape files we need for these data and includes a few other nice tools.

```{r eval=FALSE}
# Leaflet map
library(blscrapeR)
library(tigris)
library(leaflet)
map.shape <- counties(cb = TRUE, year = 2015)
df <- get_bls_county()

# Slice the df down to only the variables we need and rename "fips" colunm
# so I can get a cleaner merge later.
df <- df[, c("unemployed_rate", "fips")]
colnames(df) <- c("unemployed_rate", "GEOID")

# Merge df with spatial object.
leafmap <- geo_join(map.shape, df, by="GEOID")

# Format popup data for leaflet map.
popup_dat <- paste0("<strong>County: </strong>", 
                    leafmap$NAME, 
                    "<br><strong>Value: </strong>", 
                    leafmap$unemployed_rate)

pal <- colorQuantile("YlOrRd", NULL, n = 20)
# Render final map in leaflet.
leaflet(data = leafmap) %>% addTiles() %>%
    addPolygons(fillColor = ~pal(unemployed_rate), 
                fillOpacity = 0.8, 
                color = "#BDBDC3", 
                weight = 1,
                popup = popup_dat)

```
**Note:** This is just a static image since the full map would not be as portable for the purpose of documentation.
